# IP_Range_to_CIDR
Python script to convert IP ranges in a CSV file to their CIDRs

This is a simple script to take IPs in a CSV file and convert them to CIDR notation.

Example format of the CSV file:

192.168.0.0,192.168.255.255

10.10.0.0,10.10.255.255

There are easier ways to do this I am sure, this was just a quick throw together so that I could convert a mass of subnets quickly for a task.

You should be able to use Notepad++ and regex to quite easily get the IPs into the correct format!
